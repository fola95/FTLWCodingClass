# Welcome to FTLW Coding class!!!
In this class we are going to do a brief overview of the basics of computer science and we get to learn about the Java programming language.
This class will take the form of a "Kata". 

What's a Kata??? \
Well, a Kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practise and repetitions.
This paradigm comes from the concept of "practise makes perfect". It was originally coined from the japanese
"Kata" in martial arts.

Our goal in the coding section is to make our unit tests pass. \
If we are able to make them pass then we have mastered the concepts for the class!!

Before class please kindly perform the below installation instructions so we can start in good time:
1. Install the Java JDK from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) For windows users pls download latest java marked (X86 for 64bit and X64 for 32bit) 
2. Install intellij Idea from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac). Please make sure to download the community edition.

5. Once you launch intellij click "Checkout from version control", enter "https://github.com/fola95/FTLWCodingClass.git" in the git repository url and hit "clone".
6. A prompt will come up to ask if you want to open the project, hit "Ok".
